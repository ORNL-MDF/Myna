# Build-wise parameters
# =====================
preheat: 298.15 # K, initial ambient temperature of build chamber
material: "SS316L" # case insensitive, spaces are ignored
layer_thickness: 5.0e-05 # m, (probably won't be used in Pelican)
print_order": ["P1"] # list of part names, if printed in sequential order (only used if you want a single simulation to include multiple parts, not needed if scan path times are absolute for the build and not relative to the start of the part build time)

# Part-wise parameters
# =====================
# Each part has a dictionary of parameters, with the part name being the dictionary key
P1:
    spot_size: 0.13 # mm, spot size of the beam, assumed to be D4sigma by all simulations so far
    laser_power: 350.0 # W, constant laser power. Will assume transient power in data stream if not present
    stl: "example.stl" # str, path to STL file associated with the part. Used by simulations that mesh the part geometry, rather than assume some simplistic boundary condition.
