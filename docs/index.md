Myna is an open-source tool for connecting simulation pipelines with additive
manufacturing process data.

Myna was originally developed for the data structure maintained by ORNL
MDF's Peregrine tool for laser powderbed fusion, but has since implemented several
other datastructures for integration with other data sources.

The source code and installation instructions can be found on the Myna GitHub
repository: [https://github.com/ORNL-MDF/Myna](https://github.com/ORNL-MDF/Myna)

## Citing

If you use Myna in your work, please cite the version of Myna used via the Zenodo DOI
([link to most recent release](https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.13345124)).
In addition, please cite any of the relevant journal articles:

- [Knapp et al. (2025)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.commatsci.2025.114094) describes
  the background for Myna and the 3DThesis, AdditiveFOAM, and ExaCA applications for
  melt pool and microstructure simulations.
- [Knapp et al. (2023)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.addma.2023.103861) introduces the
  concept of leverging the digital thread for simulations using the precursor to
  Myna and provides details on the solidification data clustering approach.

The `examples/Peregrine` directory used for examples are from the publicly
available Peregrine v2023-10 dataset. If you use this data, please cite
