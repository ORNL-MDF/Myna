The CLI is called via <code>myna launch_peregrine ...</code>. Instructions for how to setup and use the Myna tools in Peregrine are provided in the Peregrine user manual. The documentation here describes the general functionality of the CLI and how to develop additional functionality.</p> <p>The main parameter that is used to construct the input file for the specified pipeline is the <code>--mode &lt;str&gt;</code> argument passed to the CLI. This tells Myna which template input file to use, evaluated as <code>f\"cli/peregrine_launcher/input_{mode}.yaml\"</code>. These templates have to define the simulation steps to take, though many of the details of each step are defined by the <code>peregrine_default_workspace.yaml</code> file. Additional modes can be added, but they will only be accessible in Peregrine if corresponding changes are made within Peregrine.</p> <p>While this CLI was developed with the intention to interact with Peregrine, it can generally be used to run cases for specific builds, parts, and layers within a database.

There are two types of metadata base classes, file-based and value-based metadata. The file-based metadata base classes are defined in <code>myna.core.metadata.file</code> and define file metadata as being associated with a build, a part, or a layer.

An good example of a component class with the features mentioned above is <code>myna.core.components.ComponentSolidificationPart</code>. That class does not require a particular input file, it outputs a file class of <code>FileGV</code> and requires several pieces of metadata. Additionally, it is associated with layer-wise part simulations, hence the extension of the component types <code>self.types.extend([\"part\", \"layer\"])</code>. The main functionality of components are largely defined in the base Component class with the intention to keep implementing new components fairly lightweight.</p> <p>Once a new component is implemented, the <code>myna config</code> functionality will be enabled, regardless of if there is an existing application. This will allow you to test that the correct metadata is being supplied to the case directories. When composing your input file, just provide an arbitrary name for the application, e.g., \"test\".</p>"},{"location":"developer_guide/#developing-new-applications","title":"Developing new applications","text":"<p>Once a new component is implemented, you will have to implement a corresponding application (app) to use with <code>myna run</code>. Applications consist of up to three scripts:</p> <ol> <li><code>config.py</code>: Script that configures the files within each Myna case folder generated during <code>myna config</code>. At the end of this script, each case folder should be a valid case directory for whatever model is being run.</li> <li><code>execute.py</code>: Script that executes the model for each case.</li> <li><code>postprocess.py</code>: Script that converts the output of the model into the required myna file format for the component. This may be part of execute.py, as well.</li> </ol> <p>These scripts are run sequentially and are mainly separated for clarity of the app functionality and for handling runtime issues. Technically all functionality can be in one script, however, this may get confusing so it is recommended to split functions into three scripts. If the model is not Python-based, these scripts can simply wrap other scripts as needed. All steps are optional and if one of these scripts is not present, it will be ignored.</p> <p>Many of the already implemented apps use the <code>argparse</code> library to parse user-specified inputs. In the input file, <code>configure</code>, <code>execute</code>, and <code>postprocess</code> allow users to pass options to each of the scripts for the app. Any parameters that you wish to have accessible to users are intended to be adjusted through such options, which are passed to the script via command line in the format <code>--key value</code> or <code>--key</code> for Boolean flags. For Boolean flags, the assumed behavior is False if the flag is not passed and True if the flag is passed.</p> <p>It is likely that your app will require a <code>template</code> directory, or a set of input files for your model that get copied into every case. If you are using a template directory, then the intended functionality is that during <code>config.py</code> the template folder is copied into each of the case directory and then updated. Updating the files inside the original template folder should be avoided.</p>"},{"location":"docker/","title":"Docker Container","text":"<p>To use the containerized version of Myna and it's open-source dependencies, you can use the Myna Docker container hosted at https://github.com/ORNL-MDF/containers.</p> <ol> <li>Install Docker Desktop under an    appropriate license.</li> <li>Open Docker Desktop.</li> <li>Pull the Myna Docker image.
