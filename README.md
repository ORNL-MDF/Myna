# Myna

**NOTE**: This repository contains working examples of the workflow, but on-going
development may change directory structures, output files, etc. from previous versions.

Detailed documentation for Myna can be found at
[https://ornl-mdf.github.io/myna-docs/](https://ornl-mdf.github.io/myna-docs/).

## Description

Myna is a framework to facilitate modeling and simulation workflows for additive
manufacturing based on build data stored in a digital factory framework, initially
developed for the database structure maintained by ORNL MDF's Peregrine tool.

There are three top-level submodules within Myna:

- `core`: contains class definitions for metadata, file types, and workflow components,
as well as the core functionality for running Myna workflows
- `application`: implementations of wrappers for various models to satisfy the
requirements of the defined Myna workflow steps
- `database`: implementations of readers for different database types

## Installation

Myna is a Python package which requires Python 3. You must install it locally as an
editable package using `pip install -e .`, which is a temporary requirement that will
be changed in future releases. The `myna` package is not on PyPI. To install `myna`
follow the instructions below. For additional details, see
[Getting Started](https://ornl-mdf.github.io/myna-docs/getting_started).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ORNL-MDF/Myna
cd Myna
pip install -e .
```

External, non-Python dependencies are required depending on which applications you
intend to use:

- [3DThesis](https://github.com/ORNL-MDF/3DThesis), commit 646d461 or later
- [AdditiveFOAM](https://github.com/ORNL/AdditiveFOAM), version 1.0
- [ExaCA](https://github.com/LLNL/ExaCA), version 1.3 or later

## Usage

Myna input files define the order of simulation steps and the options for each step.
Optional workspaces can also be created as `.yaml` or `.myna-workspace` files that can
be referenced to share common settings across multiple input files. See
[examples/solidification_part/readme.md](examples/solidification_part/readme.md) for
details on running an example case.

  melt pool and microstructure simulations.
- [Knapp et al. (2023)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.addma.2023.103861) introduces the
